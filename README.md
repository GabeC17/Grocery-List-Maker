# To-Do-List
This pogram creates a to-do list/ grocery list based on user input.
When you run the program you will need to answer a question with numbers 1-8. Then, depending on the number you chose, you will provide the information needed. The program runs until you decide to exit the program by choosing the correct option(8). Have Fun!😁
